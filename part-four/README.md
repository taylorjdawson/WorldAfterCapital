# Part Three: Enhancing Freedom

My first major aim in writing this book was to establish that we are currently experiencing a period of non-linearity, and my second aim is to propose how we might transition to the Knowledge Age. Our challenge is to overcome the limits of capitalism and move away from a society that is centered on the job loop towards one that embraces the knowledge loop. This section of *The World After Capital* will propose regulatory changes that would increase human freedom and unlock the promise of the digital knowledge loop. There are three components to this: 

1. Economic freedom. We must ensure that everyoneâ€™s needs are met without them being forced into the job loop. Once we have economic freedom, we can embrace automation and enable everyone to participate in and benefit from the digital knowledge loop. 

2. Informational freedom. We must remove barriers from the digital knowledge loop that limit learning from existing knowledge, in order to accelerate the creation and sharing of new knowledge. At the same time, we must build systems into the digital knowledge loop that support critical inquiry. 

3. Psychological freedom. We must free ourselves from scarcity thinking and its associated fears that impede our participation in the digital knowledge loop. Much of the perceived peril arises from a lack of psychological freedom. 

With these increased individual freedoms will come the possibility of a peaceful transition from the Industrial Age to the Knowledge Age that is not dictated and top-down, but one that results from individual choices. There is no guarantee that these changes will be sufficient to avoid a disastrous transition, but I am convinced that without them we are headed for just that, incurring a species-level risk for humanity. Later in the book I will discuss the values and systems that are necessary for successful collective action in a world of increased individual freedom.
