# Psychological Freedom

Imagine you live in a society that has achieved economic and informational freedom. Would you make good use of those freedoms, or would your beliefs and fears hold you back from engaging in the knowledge loop? Or worse yet, would your attention be taken up by systems designed to capture it for their own benefit?
 
In this situation, would you feel free to pursue your own interests, or would your Industrial Age beliefs keep you trapped in the job loop? Would you have a strong sense of purpose, or would you feel adrift without a clear career path and a boss telling you what to do? Would you seek out new knowledge, or would you confirm what you already believe? Would you feel free to create, or would you hold yourself back? And would you recognize when your attention is being manipulated for the benefit of others? 

While the previous sections on economic and informational freedom examined changes that require collective action, this section addresses individual action. We must free ourselves from our deeply engrained Industrial Age beliefs, and we can start on that path by developing some form of mindfulness practice. This is essential to freely directing our attention in the Knowledge Age. 

We should start by acknowledging the profound psychological dimension of the transition out of the Industrial Age. Social and economic disruption were making life stressful even before the COVID-19 pandemic. The unfolding climate crisis and the ongoing escalation of political and social tensions around the world are further causes for anxiety. To make matters worse, we have yet to learn to live healthily with new technology and obsessively check our smartphones during meetings, while driving and before we go to sleep. This is taking an immense psychological toll, as increases in sleep disorders, suicide rates, drug overdoses and antisocial activities show.

We need to go beyond that general insight about the population at large and look at what goes on in our own heads, but that requires time and effort because our brains are easily highjacked by emotions which interfere with introspection. Can we overcome the anxieties that might prevent us from gaining, creating and sharing knowledge? Can we put down our phones, when they are designed to draw us in? It might seem a monumental task, but humankind is uniquely adaptable. After all, we have navigated two prior transitions that required dramatic psychological change, first from the Forager Age to the Agrarian Age, and then to the Industrial Age. 

We now understand why humans can adapt so well. As neuroscientists have discovered, our brains remain plastic even as we age, meaning that what and how we think can be changed. In fact, we can change it quite deliberately, with techniques such as meditation, breathing and cognitive behavioral therapy [113]. The brain consists both of lower-order systems that produce emotions and higher-order systems that allow for rational thought. Techniques such as conscious breathing offer a way to use our higher-order reasoning to shape our reaction to lower-order emotions. A recent Stanford University study found the neural pathway by which slowing down our breathing lets us calm our mind. 

Modern scientific knowledge thus confirms what we have known since ancient times. In the Western tradition, the Stoic philosophers developed practices of thought to temper the emotions. In the Eastern traditions such as Buddhism, meditation and breathing achieve a similar psychological freedom. We will now examine what we need to free ourselves from, in order that we can direct our attention to the knowledge loop. 


## Freedom from Wanting

The extraordinary success of capitalism has made us confused about work and consumption; we now see them as sources of purpose, instead of as means to an end. Working harder and consuming more allows the economy to grow, so that we can work harder and consume more. Though this sounds crazy, it has become the default position. We went so far as to ingrain this view in religion, moving to a Protestant work ethic that encourages working harder and earning more [114]. Similar changes have taken place throughout Asia, where Confucianism and other religions have undergone this transition.
 
Even worse, we frequently find ourselves trapped in so-called ‘positional consumption’. If our neighbor buys a new car, we find ourselves wanting an even newer and more expensive model. Such behavior has emerged not just with respect to goods but also to services – think of the $1,000 haircut [115] or the $595-per-person dinner at a Michelin-starred restaurant [117]. Of course, much of this confusion was fueled by trillions of dollars of advertising spend aimed at convincing us to buy more, flooding us with imagery of how happy we would be if only we bought more. Between economic policy, advertising and religion, it is no wonder that many people are convinced that materialism is part of human nature. 

However, our addiction to consumption is exactly that – an addiction that exploits a mechanism in the brain. When you desire something, a new car for instance, your brain gets a dopamine hit based on your anticipated happiness, which makes you feel good. Once you get the car, you compare it to your prior expectations. If having the car turns out to be less than you expected, your dopamine levels will decrease and this can cause extreme disappointment. If your expectations are met, your dopamine levels will stay constant. Only if your expectations are exceeded will you get another hit of dopamine. The unfortunate result of this is known as the ‘hedonic treadmill’. When your brain is accustomed to certain levels of dopamine, the level required to produce the same feeling of happiness increases. You’ll have to raise your expectations even further to get that initial dopamine kick again [116]. 

That same mechanism, however, can provide long term motivation when the anticipation is aimed at creation or exploration instead of consumption. As an artist or scientist, you can forever seek out new subjects. As a traveler, you can forever seek out new destinations. Freedom from wanting is possible if we recognize that we can point our brain away from consumption and towards other pursuits, many of which are part of the knowledge loop. Redirecting our reward mechanism re-establishes the difference between needs and wants. You need to eat, while you may want to eat at a Michelin-starred restaurant. You need to drink water, while you may want to drink an expensive wine. This is why universal basic income, as discussed earlier, focuses on meeting needs rather than wants. Once you are economically free to meet your needs and have freed yourself from wanting, you can direct your attention into the knowledge loop. 

Suppose skiing is your passion and you want to keep seeking the perfect powder – how would a UBI let you focus your attention on it? On a UBI alone, you might not be able to afford an annual ski trip to the Swiss alps, but ski equipment is actually not expensive when you consider that it can last for many years and can be shared with others. And if you’re willing to hike up a mountain, you can ski as much as you want without buying a lift pass at an expensive resort. 

In this instance, psychological freedom means freeing yourself of assumptions that you might have about how to go skiing. It helps, of course, to remind yourself that many of these assumptions are formed by companies that have a commercial interest in portraying skiing that way. If you can learn to reframe it as an outdoor adventure and a chance to be in nature, it needn’t be expensive. A similar logic holds for any number of other activities. 

To free ourselves from wanting, we should remind ourselves of the difference between needs and wants, learn how our brain works and point our seeking away from consumption and towards creative activities. For many of us, that means letting go of existing attachments to wants that we have developed over a long time. Finally, we should always cast a critical eye on the advertising we encounter, understanding that it perpetuates illusions about needs and wants and keeps us trapped in the job loop.


## Freedom to Learn

Young kids ask upwards of three hundred questions a day [118]. Humans are naturally curious, and it is this curiosity that has driven much of our progress. At the same time, our curiosity was not well-suited to the Industrial Age. If you employ people in a factory job that has them performing the same action all day every day, curiosity will hinder rather than help them. The same goes for many modern service jobs, such as operating a cash register or delivering packages.
 
The present-day educational system was built to support the job loop of the industrial economy, so it is not surprising that it tends to suppress rather than encourage curiosity. While educators hardly ever state ‘suppressing curiosity’ as their goal, many of our educational practices do exactly that. For instance, forcing every eight-year-old to learn the same things in math, teaching for tests and cuts to music and art classes all discourage curiosity. 

A critical way that we undermine curiosity is by evaluating areas of knowledge according to whether we think they will help us get a ‘good job’. If your child expressed an interest in learning Swahili or wanting to play the mandolin, would you support that? Or would you say something like, ‘But how will you earn a living with that?’ The latest iteration of this thinking is an enthusiasm for learning how to code because of high-paying jobs in software; instead of encouraging curiosity about coding, either for its own sake or as a tool in science or art, we force it into the Industrial Age logic of the job loop.

We need to free ourselves from this instrumental view of knowledge and embrace learning for its own sake. As we have already seen, UBI can go a long way in allying fears that we won’t be able to support ourselves if we let our curiosity guide our learning. But will we have enough engineers and scientists in such a world? If anything, it is likely that we will have more than under the current system – after all, forcing kids to study something is a surefire way to squelch their natural curiosity. 

The knowledge loop, accelerated by digital technology, brings to the fore other limits to learning that we must also overcome. The first of these is confirmation bias. As humans we find it easier to process information that confirms what we already believe to be true. We can access a huge amount of online content that confirms our pre-existing beliefs rather than learning something new. We risk becoming increasingly entrenched in these views, fracturing into groups with strong and self-reinforcing beliefs. This phenomenon becomes even more pronounced with the automatic personalization of many Internet systems, with ‘filter bubbles’ screening out conflicting information [120]. 

Another barrier to learning is the human tendency to jump to conclusions on the basis of limited data. After a study suggested that smaller schools tended to produce better student performance than larger schools, educators began to create a lot of smaller schools, only for a subsequent study to find that a lot of smaller schools were also doing poorly. It turns out that the more students a school has, the more likely it is to approximate the overall distribution of students. A small school is therefore more likely to have students who perform predominantly well or poorly. 

Daniel Kahneman discusses these biases in his book Thinking, Fast and Slow. We employ heuristics that result in confirmation bias and storytelling because many of the systems in the human brain are optimized for speed and effortlessness. In a world with an analog knowledge loop, more time exists to correct for these biases. But in a high-velocity digital knowledge loop, we must slow ourselves down or risk passing along incorrect stories. A recent study showed that rumors spread online many times more quickly than truths [121]. 

The bulk of the systems we currently interact with online are designed to appeal to our cognitive biases rather than to help us overcome them. Companies such as Facebook and Twitter become more valuable as they capture more of our attention through appealing to what Kahneman calls ‘System 1’, the parts of our brain that run automatically and are responsible for our cognitive biases. You are much more likely to look at cute animal pictures or status updates from your friends than to read an in-depth analysis of a proposal for a carbon tax. The recent explosion of ‘fake news’ exploits this flaw in our systems, making large-scale manipulation possible. 

New systems can help here. We might, for instance, imagine an online reader that presents opposing viewpoints to a given story. For each topic, you could explore both ‘similar’ and ‘opposing’ views. Such a reader could be presented as a browser plug-in, so that when you’ve ventured beyond the confines of a social media platform and are perusing content on the Web, you could bring that exploration with you [122]. 

Fundamentally though, we all have to actively work on engaging what Kahneman calls ‘System 2’, the part of our brain that requires effort but lets us think independently and rationally. Developing and keeping up some kind of mindfulness practice is a key enabler for overcoming biases and freeing ourselves to learn.


## Freedom to Create

After learning, the next step in the knowledge loop is creating. Here, we also need to work on our freedom – as Picasso once said, ‘Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once we grow up.’ We censor ourselves as adults, inhibiting the natural creativity we enjoyed as children. The educational system, with its focus on preparing for standardized tests, further crushes our creative impulses. Many of people eventually come to believe that creativity is something that they are not capable of.
 
The job loop further solidifies these beliefs about creativity, and even institutionalizes them; society categorizes people into amateurs and professionals. We venerate the professional guitar player, artist or sculptor but denigrate the amateur, dismissing their work as ‘amateurish’ or ‘amateur hour’. When we start to measure creativity by how much money an artist or musician makes rather than the passion they feel for a pursuit, there is no wonder that many people fear they will never measure up. 

Distractions also inhibit our impulses to create – there’s always another YouTube video to watch or another email to read. Our brains are poorly suited to environments that are overloaded with information. We evolved in a world where obtaining information – for instance, the sound of an approaching animal – could be a matter of life or death, and our brains are easily distracted. 

In order to be able to create, we need to disconnect ourselves from many of those stimuli. Again, a mindfulness practice will be helpful here by allowing us to tune out interruptions, and there are many hacks we can use to prevent them in the first place.


## Freedom to Share

Even after we have created something, many of us fear that when we share it, it will be criticized – someone will call our painting ugly, our code incompetent or our proposal naive. Given the state of much online commentary and the prevalence of ‘trolling’, those fears are well-founded, but they need not inhibit our participation in the knowledge loop. Part of the answer is to work on the inner strength to continue sharing, despite criticism.
 
Another part of the answer is that we should cultivate empathy. Whenever we comment on the work of others online, we should keep in mind that they dared to create and share it. And we should also remember that by contributing to the knowledge loop, they have engaged in the very thing that makes us human. Those who manage online communities should provide tools for flagging and banning people who are abusive or make threats aimed at shutting down sharing. 

If you live in a country that is subject to dictatorship, censorship or mob rule, sharing opinions, art or research can result in imprisonment, torture or even death. And yet despite that, we routinely find people who freely share in these places. We should take inspiration and courage from those people, and we should support people’s ability to build systems to enable sharing in these places that are censorship-resistant and allow for pseudonymous and anonymous expression. 

In the Knowledge Age, there is such a thing as sharing too much – not sharing too much personal information, but mindlessly sharing harmful information. Threats, rumors and lies can take on lives of their own, and we can find ourselves contributing to an ‘information cascade’, in which an initial bit of information picks up speed and becomes an avalanche that destroys everything in its path. 

So there is a dual aspect to having the psychological freedom to share: we need to free ourselves from fear to share our creations and our ideas, while also needing to control our emotional responses so that we do not disrupt the knowledge loop. Ask yourself whether what you’re sharing will enhance or hurt the pursuit of knowledge. If the answer is not obvious, it might be better not to share it.


## Psychological Freedom and Humanism

Self-regulation lies at the heart of psychological freedom, and allows us to separate our wants from our needs. It lets us consider our initial reactions to what others are saying, writing or doing without immediately reacting in anger. It lets us have empathy for others and to be open to learning something new. And it lets us overcome our fears of creating and sharing.
 
Still, as humans we have fundamental needs for purpose and recognition that make many of us psychologically unfree. Existential angst can express itself in many different forms, ranging from an inability to do anything to a manic desire to do everything. The persistence of religion is partly explained by addressing these needs. Most religions claim that our purpose is to follow a divine set of rules and that if we follow them, the respective god or gods will recognize our existence. 

Many organized religions intentionally disrupt the knowledge loop. They restrict the process of critical inquiry through which knowledge improves over time, through mechanisms such as censorship and divine ‘knowledge’, which is often encoded in sacred texts. This serves to maintain the power of the gatekeepers to the texts and their interpretation. While adhering to a religion may meet your existential psychological needs, it may also make it difficult for you to participate fully and freely in the knowledge loop. 

The same is true for many informal beliefs. The belief in a preordained individual destiny can be used to answer one’s need for purpose, but it also prevents one from being psychologically free. Or people can belong to communities that meet the individual need for recognition, but impose a need for conformity that restricts participation in the knowledge loop. It can often be difficult to recognize how much of one’s behavior is controlled by custom or peer pressure. 

A new humanism, which recognizes the importance of knowledge, provides an alternative source of purpose that does not inhibit psychological freedom but rather enhances it. Participating in the knowledge loop is our purpose; learning new things, being creative and sharing with others is encouraged. This doesn’t mean that everyone has to be the proverbial ‘rocket scientist’ – there are a great many ways to participate in the knowledge loop, including creating art and caring for others and the environment. 

In order to help people be psychologically free, we need to substantially change most countries’ education systems; today’s systems were developed to support the Industrial Age, and their goal is to produce people to participate in the job loop. We need a system that celebrates knowledge for its own sake, allows students to discover their individual interests and deepen them into a purpose, and educates them about how to be psychologically free. Put differently, we need to put humanism at the center of learning. 

Humanism and the knowledge loop thus have important implications for how we can reorganize society and take responsibility for the world around us. And this will be the subject of Part Five.
